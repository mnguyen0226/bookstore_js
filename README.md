Question 2: Question: In CSS file, the styling is very clean. I found myself starting with create a lot of style for each element, I try to group them for specific element but end up split again so that I can reuse specific styling.

I end up having 1 div with 4-6 classes of CSS, is this number too high? Do you recommend any tools or guideline to write a cleaner CSS code?
