# bookstore_js
Designing an online bookstore using Java, TypeScript, Vue.js, MySQL, HTML5, and CSS

TODO:
- Change Font
- Resize the book with centure position (index.html)
- Check padding around everything
- Piazza: When to design a generic and specific CSS? -> Piazza
- Book information (title/author/price) should be styled differently from one another. Do not use the exact same stylings from Another Bookstore.
- Clean up CSS

Question: How much code can we change compared to the original one
Question: Good coding CSS; when to group or create a new style?
Question: Book size is larger if this is ok?
Question: Grade base on P1 design as well?
